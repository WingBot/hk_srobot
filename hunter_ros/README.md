# ROS Packages for Hunter Mobile Base

## Packages

* hunter_base: a ROS wrapper around Hunter SDK to monitor and control the robot
* hunter_bringup: launch and configuration files to start ROS nodes 
* hunter_description: urdf models
* hunter_msgs: hunter related message definitions
* (hunter_ros: meta package for the Scout robot ROS packages)
* hunter_webots_sim: webot-based simulator for hunter

## Communication interface setup

### Setup CAN interface on Nvidia Jetson Platforms

Nvidia Jeston TX2/Xavier/XavierNX have CAN controller(s) integrated in the main SOC. If you're using a dev kit, you also need to add a CAN transceiver for proper CAN communication. 

Please refer to this [note](https://wiki.rdu.im/_pages/Notes/Embedded-System/Linux/can-bus-in-linux.html) to learn more about the most commonly-used CAN interface commands in Linux.

### Setup CAN-To-USB adapter 

For testing, you can use the CAN-To-USB adapter to talk with the robot on any desktop/laptop:
 
1. Enable gs_usb kernel module
   
    ```
    $ sudo modprobe gs_usb
    ```

2. Bringup can device
   
   ```
   $ sudo ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 500000
   ```

3. If no error occured during the previous steps, you should be able to see the can device now by using command
   
   ```
   $ ifconfig -a
   ```

4. Install and use can-utils to test the hardware
   
    ```
    $ sudo apt install can-utils
    ```

5. Testing command
   
    ```
    # receiving data from can0
    $ candump can0
    # send data to can0
    $ cansend can0 001#1122334455667788
    ```

Two scripts inside the "hunter_bringup/scripts" folder are provided for easy setup. You can run "./setup_can2usb.bash" for the first-time setup and run "./bringup_can2usb.bash" to bring up the device each time you unplug and re-plug the adapter.

## Basic usage of the ROS package

1. Install dependent ROS packages

    ```
    $ sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-teleop-twist-keyboard
    $ sudo apt-get install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-joint-state-publisher-gui
    $ sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-ros-controllers
    $ sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-webots-ros
    ```

2. Clone the packages into your catkin workspace and compile

    (the following instructions assume your catkin workspace is at: ~/catkin_ws/src)

    ```
    $ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
    $ git clone -b catkin https://github.com/westonrobot/wrp_sdk.git
    $ git clone https://github.com/westonrobot/hunter_ros.git
    $ cd ..
    $ catkin_make
    ```

3. Setup Webots simulation    

* Install Webots R2020a-rev1 (download from https://cyberbotics.com/ )

* Set WEBOTS_HOME variable, add the following line to your "~/.bashrc"

    ```
    export WEBOTS_HOME=/usr/local/webots
    ```

    Adjust the path accordingly if you installed Webots to a different place.

4. Launch ROS nodes
 
* Start the base node for the real robot

    ```
    $ roslaunch hunter_bringup hunter_base.launch
    ```

* Start the Webots-based simulation

    ```
    $ roslaunch hunter_bringup hunter_base_webots_sim.launch
    ```
    
**SAFETY PRECAUSION**: 

Always have your remote controller ready to take over the control whenever necessary.
